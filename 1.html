         Contrary to popular belief, <p>Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.</p>
         <h1>It has roots</h1> <h2>in a piece of classical</h2> Latin literature from 45 BC,
         making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
         looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage,
         <hr>
         and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
         Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"
         <hr>
         <hr>
         (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics,
         very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",
         comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
